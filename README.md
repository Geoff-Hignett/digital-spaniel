# digital-spaniel

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in development mode whilst json-server is being used (it is currently being used)

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in development mode as long as json-server is not being used

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production

### Notes
Homepage nav links are currently pointing to the "/" path to test the active class. Adjust to "/page" once pages are created.
